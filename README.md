# DashBoard
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This is a static website which is nothing but the dashboard of a student(Mani Saketh). This is done using HTML and CSS where I used cards, different kinds of tags such as img tag, div tag, heading tags, etc, buttons, marquee, etc, and classes from HTML and many CSS properties like postion, text-align, margin, background-color, color, etc. I used both INTERNAL STYLING and EXTERNAL STYLING to built this website.

<h2>What happens in the website when I click anything?</h2>
1. Firstly, at the top of the website, one can see the name MANI SAKETH, if we move the cursor over there, we can see a dropdown box styled by CSS which gives the option to logout. If the person select to logout, then it will be redirected to another page which leaves a thank you message with an image.<br>
